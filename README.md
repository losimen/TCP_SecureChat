# SecureChat
## Description
SecureChat is my demo-messenger for GL Task 2. Fast and secure (not yet honestly :D).


## Features:
- Unlimeted chats per user.
- Unlimated users per chat.
- Auto-rendering of incomming messages.
- UI displays emojies.
- Possibility to communicate on Ukrainian + English (russian isn't welcome :D).
- Multithreading server (tested on 30 connections).
- Encryption/decryption password on server-side.
- Encryption/Decryption is not finished on client-side, to use current version of client, you - have to use server from 57e555f1 commit.

## Todo:

- finish encryption/decryption on client-side
- fix server architecture
- highlight incomming messages + chats
- make friendship system with users
- move UI to QML
